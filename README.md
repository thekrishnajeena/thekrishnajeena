# 👋 Hey, I’m Krishna  

> “Curiosity built my code.”  

I’m an **Android Developer** who believes apps aren’t just built — they’re *crafted*.  
Currently exploring how design, data, and behavior connect inside a device, one project at a time.  

### 💡 What I’m Building & Learning
- 📱 Android development with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Retrofit**, and clean architecture.  
- 🌐 Experimenting with **Next.js** & **TypeScript** for modern web projects.  
- 🤖 Curious about how **AI** can amplify creative work, not replace it.  
- 🧠 Constantly learning to simplify complexity, one concept at a time.  

### 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python  
**Frameworks & Tools:** Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, Room, Next.js, Node.js  
**Other Interests:** UI/UX, System Design, and Minimal Aesthetics  

### 🚀 Projects You Might Like
- **Buddha Quotes App** → daily wisdom in minimalist design.  
- **Persona App** → a distraction-free personal hub for moments, books, and notes.  
- “Buy Me a Book” – a donation-driven experiment in simplicity.  

### 🌱 Philosophy
> I build not to add noise, but to make clarity accessible.

Every project I make is a step toward better systems, in design, thought, and code.
